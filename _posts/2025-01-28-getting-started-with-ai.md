Many small businesses know they should be using AI, but don't know where to start. This guide breaks down the process into manageable steps.

## Start with the Problem, Not the Technology

The biggest mistake businesses make is starting with the technology. Instead:

1. **Identify repetitive tasks** - What takes your team hours every week?
2. **Look for data bottlenecks** - Where does information get stuck?
3. **Find decision delays** - What choices slow down your operations?

## Quick Wins vs. Long-term Strategy

### Quick Wins (1-2 weeks)
- Automated email responses
- Content generation for marketing
- Basic data analysis tools

### Strategic Initiatives (2-6 months)
- Customer service automation
- Predictive analytics for inventory
- Personalized marketing campaigns

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-automation** - Keep the human touch where it matters
2. **Data privacy concerns** - Always prioritize customer trust
3. **Integration complexity** - Start simple, scale gradually
