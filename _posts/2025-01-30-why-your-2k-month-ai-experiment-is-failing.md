Three months ago, I decided to test whether local AI models could actually help with product management work. The results were... educational.

After trying to get a local LLM to write a simple product document, I got pages of repetitive text like: "The Moon is a natural resource that can be mined for use on Earth. The Moon is a natural resource that can be mined for use on Earth." Repeated 200+ times.

If you're spending around £2K monthly on AI tools (a typical range for SMBs using multiple AI subscriptions) and seeing similarly disappointing results, you're not alone. Most London SMBs are making the same fundamental mistakes I made.

## The Three Failure Patterns I See Every Week

**Mistake #1: Choosing AI Tools Without Understanding Their Limitations**

When I experimented with local LLMs for product work, I thought a smaller model would be sufficient for basic document generation. The reality? Even simple tasks produced gibberish or got stuck in repetitive loops like "The Moon is a natural resource that can be mined for use on Earth" repeated endlessly.

Many SMBs are choosing AI tools without understanding what they can and can't actually do. The gap between expectations and practical functionality catches most people off guard.

**Mistake #2: Expecting AI to Work Like a Human Employee**

During my app development experiment with Cursor, I learned that AI coding tools don't replace expertise - they amplify it. When I didn't understand Swift programming, Cursor created compilation errors and duplicate files that made everything worse.

I see SMBs treating AI like a junior employee who can figure things out independently. AI tools work best when you understand the domain well enough to guide them effectively.

**Mistake #3: No Clear Success Metrics**

After spending weeks experimenting with different AI models and prompts, I realized most of my "testing" was actually just hoping something would magically work better. Without clear criteria for what "success" looked like, I couldn't tell if a solution was genuinely useful or just occasionally impressive.

Most businesses start AI experiments without defining what problem they're solving or how they'll measure improvement.

## Why Most AI Implementations Fail

Based on direct experience with various AI tools, here are the real reasons your AI experiment might be struggling:

**Context Window Problems:** Many AI tools work poorly when you give them too much information at once. I discovered that detailed prompts often produced worse results than simple, focused requests.

**The Setup Barrier:** Getting AI tools properly configured takes much longer than advertised. Setting up Xcode to work with Cursor took over an hour and killed my initial enthusiasm. Many teams give up during configuration rather than implementation.

**Prompt Engineering Reality:** Effective AI use requires understanding how to communicate with the tools. This isn't intuitive - it's a skill that takes practice. Most teams expect immediate results without investing time in learning effective prompting.

**Model Limitations:** Different AI models have different strengths. The local model I tested had severe limitations for general productivity tasks. Using the wrong tool for your specific needs guarantees poor results.

## What Actually Works (Lessons from Real Implementation)

After months of experimenting, here's what I learned about practical AI implementation:

**Start Smaller:** Instead of trying to automate entire workflows, identify one specific task AI can handle well. The childminder app I built focused solely on converting photos and simple inputs into reports - nothing more complex.

**Understand Your Domain:** AI tools work best when you can guide them effectively. For app development, I needed to understand how files connected before Cursor could help meaningfully.

**Accept Limitations:** The most useful question I learned to ask Cursor was "Ask me questions until you're 95% sure how to implement this." This acknowledged that AI needs guidance rather than hoping it would figure things out alone.

**Focus on Iteration:** Rather than expecting perfect results immediately, treat AI implementation like any other business process - test, measure, adjust.

## The Fix: A Different Approach

If your AI experiment isn't delivering results, here's how to get back on track:

**Audit Your Current Setup:** Are you using the right tools for your specific use cases? Many failures come from mismatched expectations and capabilities.

**Define Success Clearly:** What specific outcome would make your AI investment worthwhile? Time saved? Quality improved? Process simplified?

**Start Fresh with One Use Case:** Pick the simplest possible task where AI could add value. Perfect that before expanding.

Most importantly, stop throwing money at AI tools hoping something will stick. Successful AI implementation requires the same disciplined approach as any business investment.

## Your Next Move

The businesses succeeding with AI aren't using more sophisticated tools - they're using appropriate tools effectively.

If you're spending significant money on AI tools without clear results, you need an honest assessment of what's working, what isn't, and why.

No sales pitch - just a realistic evaluation of where your AI investment makes sense and where it's probably wasting money.
